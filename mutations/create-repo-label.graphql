# Create a label in a specified repo for the currently
# validated user.
#
# Use user-repos-name_id_priv.graphql to retreive a list of 
# repositories and their id's.
# 
# NOTE: You MUST edit the HTTP header that is sent with the 
# mutation. The GraphiQL application allows for that, but the
# GitHub GraphQL Exporer does NOT!
#
# Add this to the header:
#   Accept:application/vnd.github.bane-preview+json
# 
# Label information:
#   https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/graphql/overview/schema-previews#labels-preview
#
mutation($label:CreateLabelInput!) {
  createLabel(input:$label) {
    label {
      id
      name
      color
      description
      updatedAt
    }
  }
}

## Variable(s): If using the GraphiQL app the following gets
# placed in the "QUERY VARIABLES" pane without the "#" on 
# each line.
#{
#  "label": {
#    "repositoryId": "Your chosen repo's ID",
#    "name": "GraphQL Label",

# The following is POST-ready, it can be used as the body
# in a POST operation. This can be used with Postman.
